            <h5>To ensure a hassle-free return or replacement experience, we strongly recommend recording an unboxing video
                while opening your package. This video should clearly show:</h5>
    
            <ul>
                <li class="policy_font">The package in its original sealed condition.</li>
                <li class="policy_font">The opening process.</li>
                <li class="policy_font">The product received inside.</li>
                <li class="policy_font">The unboxing video serves as vital proof in case of any issues and helps us resolve your request more
                efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
